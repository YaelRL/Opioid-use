# Opioid-use
This studyâ€™s goal is understanding factors and correlates of chronic pain and opioid use. The analysis was performed on the 2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the CDC.
The analysis included identifying factors and interactions associated with chronic pain and prescription opioid use for chronic pain, fitting and evaluating prediction models for chronic pain and prescription opioid use.
Disability and health-related variables were prominent predictors for chronic pain and opioid use, whereas socio-demographic and life style factors had a minor effect.
The prediction model for chronic pain achieved a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 77%.
The prediction model for prescription opioid use achieved a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 80%.
